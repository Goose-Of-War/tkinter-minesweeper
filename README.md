# tkinter-minesweeper
 Making a Minesweeper in Python using tkinter

##
Hello once again, from your dear ol' Goos. This one is something which I did in the beginning of the lockdown. I was interested in Minesweeper around the beginning of 2020 and seeing how simple it was, I wanted to make a copy of the same. 

In the lockdown, I made 2 copies of the game - one being a shabby mess of a code, while the other being a wee bit better than the first one. In case you want to see the 2nd edition, [click here](https://pastebin.com/mmze0P8E).

### Will it be the same thing just copied again?
I hope not. Otherwise, why bother, am I right? :sweat_smile: I'll most probably do some tweaking and make it a bit more definite rather than my older code which... I _do_ understand, just, after reading it 7 times. 

This time again, I will be using `tkinter`, with some other libraries and packages like `random` or any other thing I think might be needed.

##
### What's done till now, Goose?
Well, as of now, nothing significant is done yet. All I have on me is the grid designed and an empty click function. 

### What's coming soon?
Hopefully, the window with all the buttons.

This project is currently being updated. Until next time.
