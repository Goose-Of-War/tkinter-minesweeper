# tkinter-minesweeper
 Making a Minesweeper in Python using tkinter

## 
Hello once again, from your dear ol' Goos. This one is something which I did in the beginning of the lockdown. I was interested in Minesweeper around the beginning of 2020 and seeing how simple it was, I wanted to make a copy of the same. 

In the lockdown, I made 2 copies of the game - one being a shabby mess of a code, while the other being a wee bit better than the first one. In case you want to see the 2nd edition, [click here](https://pastebin.com/mmze0P8E).

#
### Will it be the same thing just copied again?
I hope not. Otherwise, why bother, am I right? :sweat_smile: I'll most probably do some tweaking and make it a bit more definite rather than my older code which... I _do_ understand, just, after reading it 7 times. 

This time again, I will be using `tkinter`, with some other libraries and packages like `random` or any other thing I think might be needed.

#
### What's done till now, Goose?
Well, as of now, I have the grid ready, and a window launched when I run the program, with all the buttons. If you click the buttons,  the number of mines near said tile will be displayed (i.e. of course, *if* the location is not a mine. If it is, then you get a **F**)

### What's coming soon?
Now that we have a definite button system, the upcoming tasks are somewhat clearer now. Here's what I have to do next.
- A flag system, to mark the buttons with mines (involving a button, a flag counter, and the code for the flag.)
- A second-click system which makes clearing multiple buttons at one go convenient. 
- A reset button, to restart the game if you want to.
- A victory/defeat alert system, to announce if you won or not (even tho it becomes evident by the gameplay.)

#
Well, until next time, I guess.
