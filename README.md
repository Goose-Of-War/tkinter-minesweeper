 Making a Minesweeper in Python using tkinter

## 
Hello once again, from your dear ol' Goos. This one is something which I did in the beginning of the lockdown. I was interested in Minesweeper around the beginning of 2020 and seeing how simple it was, I wanted to make a copy of the same. 

In the lockdown, I made 2 copies of the game - one being a shabby mess of a code, while the other being a wee bit better than the first one. In case you want to see the 2nd edition, [click here](https://pastebin.com/mmze0P8E).

Now, why am I making this code again if I've already made it before, you ask? There are 2 main reasons for that:
1. To refresh my grasp on using multiple objects and linking data to each other.
2. I am planning to make the same as a webpage using JavaScript. So, trial round?

#
### Will it be the same thing just copied again?
Umm, in a way, yes, and in a way, no. It's a bit different from the older versions in a few ways:
- This one is waaaay more user friendly. (No, the cat didn't sleep on the keyboard. That's how readable it has become now.)
- Using a proper dictionary with well-defined storage systems rather than a list with nested lists and sloppily written code.

Depending on how I perform, more will be added. Meanwhile, onto the similarities. This time again, I will be using `tkinter`, with some other libraries and packages like `random` or any other thing I think might be needed. I'll be working with a grid again. (I mean... the game itself is a grid. What'd you expect?)

#
### What's done till now, Goose?
A good recap of what's been done. Coming right up:
- A grid system with relevant informations for each button.
- GUI Interface (tkinter Window, with Buttons and Labels.)
- (Re)Start command
- Mine allocation based on first click.
- Click response command.
- Flag system to lock buttons with potential mines underneath.
- Victory/Defeat announcement system.

### What's coming soon?
Now that so much has been done, these are some things which you can expect to see:
- A second click system, which allows the player to clear mines more easily.
- Different difficulties.
- Different themes: Some Dark and Some Light 
- Stopwatch to note how long you take to finish.

Well, until next time, I guess.
